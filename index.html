  <h1 style="font-size:2vw; text-align:center;">Personal Life</h1>
 
<!-- This is where the paragraph one begins-->
  <p1 style="font-size:2vw"> My name is Alberto and I have been married for over 16 years and have 2 kids, a girl who is 11 years old and a boy who is 6 years old. After graduating high school in 2004, I spent about 2 years trying to figure out what to do and how to do it. First, I wanted to go to school, but the 'dream' school I wanted to go to was in Florida, a video game and design university named Fullsail. After seeing that wasn't going to happen and because of the fast food job I had I decided to join the military. At first I was going to join the Navy but decided against that and ended up joining the United States Air Force (USAF). Since 2006, I have been proudly serving our nation as a Security Forces Airman. Now, I am nearing the term for retirement from the USAF and hope to land a new career in programming.   </p1><br><br>

<h1 style="font-size:2vw; text-align:center;">Hobbies</h1>
<!-- This is where the paragraph two begins-->
<p1 style="font-size:2vw"> My hobbies include spending time with family, video games, and learning about computers and programming. Several things I enjoy doing with my family is going out for dinner to new places, grilling out a delicious steak during the winter, and taking them out to shop. Another hobby of mine as mentioned earlier are video games. Video games have been a hobby of mine since I was about 5 years old. The first console I played on was the Atari, which consisted of a boxing game and the historic Pitfall. My other hobby is using or configuring a computer. What amazes me about computers, the internet, and software is what they can do and how they can improve processes. It's a passion of mine to create something that helps others fulfill their responsibilities with little to no effort.</p1><br><br>
